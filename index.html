          <b>Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and
          Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.</b> He became a
          popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him:
          "Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism
          but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of
          Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol;
          the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months
          each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the
          rest of northern India, resounded with his name."[18] In still later
          years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in adulthood, won admirers in
          India from among a political spectrum that included both communists
          and right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh's
          associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries,
          were also involved in daring acts and were either executed or died
          violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and
          literature as did Singh, who is sometimes referred to as the
          Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great martyr" in Urdu and Punjabi)
